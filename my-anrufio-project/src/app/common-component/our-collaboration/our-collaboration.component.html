            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                The process begins by signing a non-disclosure agreement to ensure all your crucial
                business information remains confidential. This initial step protects your idea,
                vision, technologies used, or architecture details.

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                At this stage, we set a meeting between you and the CTO or BA to gather all
                requirements and understand your idea in detail. This helps create a process
                that is efficient and plan for your product as per the objectives.

                To become familiar with your product engineers, we keep our discussions more
                interactive and cover in-depth questions regarding scope, timeline, and workflow.
                This ensures clarity on the development approach.
